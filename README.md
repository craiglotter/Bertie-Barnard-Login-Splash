Bertie Barnard Login Splash
===========================

Commerce I.T. moved to sponsor a computer lab for the Bertie Barnard Primary School situated in Stilbaai. This program is launched on system login and appears as a screen-grabbing splash screen displaying a editable text message on which the student can either accept or reject logging in to the computer. If the student rejects the terms of entry, the computer will automatically logout.
